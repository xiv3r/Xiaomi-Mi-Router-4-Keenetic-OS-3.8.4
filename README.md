1. Run !Start.bat. If you have a stock , select items from 1 to 4 one by one. In the data folder there will be a backup in the factory.
If you have a different firmware , for example Padavan, skip this step
 

2. Unplug the router, press the reset button then power up while pressing the reset after that connect your pc using lamg cable and Go to Breed at 192.168.1.1. and make backups of your full and eeprom
 

3. In the archive, drag the Ultra2_Mod.bin file onto hfs.exe. Attention , someone elseâ€™s eeprom with poppies and calibrations is already built into Ultra2_Mod.bin, you can use it this way, or take it apart and change it yourself, if you wish.
